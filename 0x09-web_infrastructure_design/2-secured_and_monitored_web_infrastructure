##  Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

This setup builds on the previous one by making it more secure and reliable.

---

### 🔒 What's New?

- **Firewalls** on all 3 servers to block unwanted traffic.
- **SSL Certificate** so the site runs on HTTPS (encrypted and secure).
- **Monitoring Agents** on each server to track performance and spot issues.

---

### 🧠 Why These Changes?

- **Firewalls**: Only allow specific ports (e.g. 80, 443, 3306). Block everything else.
- **HTTPS**: Encrypts data between users and the website. Safer for everyone.
- **Monitoring**: Helps us watch server health and traffic. Useful for alerts and debugging.

---

### ⚠️ Known Problems

- **SSL ends at the load balancer**: Internal traffic isn’t encrypted. Could be risky.
- **Only one MySQL server can write**: If it fails, no data updates.
- **All servers doing everything**: Not scalable. Better to separate roles.
