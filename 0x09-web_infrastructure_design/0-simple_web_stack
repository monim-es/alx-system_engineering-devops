### 3. Server Side Components — Explained Simply

What is a Server  
A server is a physical or virtual computer that hosts your website and provides services to users.

What does the Domain Name do  
The domain name (e.g., `foobar.com`) is a human-friendly address that points to the server’s IP via DNS.

What type of DNS record is `www`  
It is an A record, mapping `www.foobar.com` to the server IP address (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).

What is the Web Server (Nginx)  
Nginx is the software that handles incoming browser requests. It serves static files directly and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

What is the Application Server  
The application server runs your website’s code (PHP, Python, etc.) to generate dynamic content based on user input or data.

What is the Codebase  
The codebase is the collection of source files and scripts that define your website’s logic and behavior.

What is the Database (MySQL)  
MySQL stores all your data (like users, posts) and responds to queries from the application server.

How does the server communicate with the user’s browser  
They use TCPIP over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol to exchange information and deliver web pages.
