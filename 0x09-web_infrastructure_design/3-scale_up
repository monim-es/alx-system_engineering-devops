### 🧱 What's in the New Setup?

#### ✅ Added Components:
- **1 new server** – to support component separation and scaling.
- **1 additional load balancer (HAProxy)** – clustered with the first one for high availability.
- **Split components**:
  - **Web Server** (Nginx) on its own machine.
  - **Application Server** on a separate machine.
  - **Database Server** (MySQL) running independently.

### 🧠 Why These Changes?

#### ➕ Extra Server
- We’re scaling up — more traffic, more load — so an extra server helps distribute the work.
- It gives flexibility to isolate roles (web, app, DB) on separate machines.

#### 🔁 Load-Balancer Cluster (HAProxy)
- Two load balancers working together (Active-Passive or Active-Active).
- If one fails, the other continues serving users — **no downtime**.
- Essential for **high availability** and **redundancy**.

#### 🧩 Splitting Components
- Having web server, application server, and database on **different servers** makes things more efficient and easier to manage:
  - Each server does **one job well** (separation of concerns).
  - Better performance, scaling, and monitoring.
  - If one part has issues (e.g. database crash), the others keep running.

### 📘 Quick Recap: Web Server vs Application Server

- **Web Server (Nginx):**  
  Handles browser requests (HTTP/HTTPS), serves static files (HTML, images), and forwards dynamic requests to the app server.

- **Application Server:**  
  Processes logic (like user logins, form handling), talks to the database, and returns results via the web server.

### ✅ Summary

| Component              | Role                                              |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Web Server (Nginx)     | Handles client requests, serves static content    |
| App Server             | Runs backend code and business logic              |
| DB Server (MySQL)      | Stores and retrieves persistent data              |
| Load Balancer Cluster  | Distributes traffic + ensures high availability   |
| Extra Server           | Supports separation, load handling, flexibility   |
